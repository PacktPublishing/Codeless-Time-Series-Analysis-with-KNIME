## Instructions and Navigations

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data analysts and data scientists who want to develop forecasting applications on time series data. While no coding skills are required thanks to the codeless implementation of the examples, basic knowledge of KNIME Analytics Platform is assumed. The first part of the book targets beginners in time series analysis, and the subsequent parts of the book challenge both beginners as well as advanced users by introducing real-world time series applications.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-14).
### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
